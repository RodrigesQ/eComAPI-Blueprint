# E-commerce Database Design

## Step 1: Identify Key Entities
For an e-commerce site, you might need the following entities:
1. **Users**: Information about customers and admin users.
2. **Products**: Details about items available for sale.
3. **Orders**: Tracks purchases made by users.
4. **Order Items**: Tracks individual items in an order (for handling multiple products in one order).
5. **Categories**: For organizing products.
6. **Reviews**: Feedback left by customers on products.
7. **Payments**: Information about transactions.

## Step 3: Define Relationships
- **Users to Orders**: One-to-Many (One user can place multiple orders).
- **Orders to Order Items**: One-to-Many (One order can have multiple items).
- **Products to Categories**: Many-to-One (A product belongs to one category, but a category can have multiple products).
- **Products to Reviews**: One-to-Many (One product can have multiple reviews).
- **Orders to Payments**: One-to-One (Each order has one associated payment).

---

## Step 4: Create an ERD
Use tools like [ERDPlus](https://erdplus.com/), [Lucidchart](https://www.lucidchart.com/), or [dbdiagram.io](https://dbdiagram.io/) to visualize the tables and relationships.

---

## Step 5: Implement the Database
Use an RDBMS like **MySQL**, **PostgreSQL**, or **SQLite** to create the tables using SQL commands or a database migration tool in your backend framework.


## Step 5: Implement the Database
Use the following SQL script to create the database and tables:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE ecommerce_db;

-- Create Users table
CREATE TABLE Users (
    user_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR NOT NULL,
    email VARCHAR UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    password VARCHAR NOT NULL,
    role VARCHAR CHECK (role IN ('customer', 'admin')) NOT NULL
);

-- Create Categories table
CREATE TABLE Categories (
    category_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR NOT NULL
);

-- Create Products table
CREATE TABLE Products (
    product_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR NOT NULL,
    description TEXT,
    price DECIMAL NOT NULL,
    stock_quantity INT NOT NULL,
    category_id INT REFERENCES Categories(category_id) ON DELETE SET NULL
);

-- Create Orders table
CREATE TABLE Orders (
    order_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id INT REFERENCES Users(user_id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    order_date TIMESTAMP NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    total_amount DECIMAL NOT NULL
);

-- Create Order_Items table (details of products in orders)
CREATE TABLE Order_Items (
    order_item_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    order_id INT REFERENCES Orders(order_id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    product_id INT REFERENCES Products(product_id),
    quantity INT NOT NULL,
    item_price DECIMAL NOT NULL
);

-- Create Reviews table
CREATE TABLE Reviews (
    review_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    product_id INT REFERENCES Products(product_id),
    user_id INT REFERENCES Users(user_id),
    rating INT CHECK (rating BETWEEN 1 AND 5),
    comment TEXT
);

-- Create Payments table
CREATE TABLE Payments (
    payment_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    order_id INT REFERENCES Orders(order_id),
    payment_date TIMESTAMP NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    amount DECIMAL NOT NULL
);

--Add ***********************************************
-- Create Carts table
CREATE TABLE Carts (
    cart_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id INT REFERENCES Users(user_id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    total_amount DECIMAL NOT NULL DEFAULT 0.00
);

-- Create Cart_Items table
CREATE TABLE Cart_Items (
    cart_item_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    cart_id INT REFERENCES Carts(cart_id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    product_id INT REFERENCES Products(product_id),
    quantity INT NOT NULL CHECK (quantity > 0),
    item_price DECIMAL NOT NULL
);

ALTER TABLE Cart_Items
ADD CONSTRAINT unique_cart_product UNIQUE (cart_id, product_id);

CREATE TABLE Product_Reservations (
    reservation_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    product_id INT NOT NULL REFERENCES Products(product_id),
    user_id INT NOT NULL REFERENCES Users(user_id),
    reserved_until TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
    reserved_quantity INT NOT NULL,
    UNIQUE (product_id, user_id) -- Ensure no duplicate reservations for the same user and product
);
